===

## Requirements

Implement a `List` constructor.

* implement `copy` as a method of your `List` constructor
* implement `push` as a method of your `List` constructor
* implement `pop` as a method of your `List` constructor
* **stretch:** implement `forEach` and/or `map` as a method of your `List` constructor

## Submission Instructions

1. Together with your assigned partner, pseudocode an implementation for a `List` constructor on the whiteboard.
1. Your partner (or you) should then begin pseudocoding and whiteboarding the solution to a method implementation of their choice.
1. Using the included `whiteboard-rubric.pdf`, evaluate your partner and provide feedback where necessary.
1. Swap roles.
1. Take a picture of your completed whiteboarding rubric and submit in Canvas.
